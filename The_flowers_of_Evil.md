## Arm
    Warming the inner men in this slothful sink
    Our misty shouldersï¼Œwill it labour to gold
    Will it glean red out of the azure muse
    Misty studio under steadfast hall

    O venal log! Oh, when may I slip
    Will it, when July flash our cloudy
    Glean misty log to gold our red shoulders
    You must, to flash their vulgar noon bread

    As cloudy labour outside my graveyard log
    Knowing my log and birth both are poison
    Praise stupefaction, in all delight

    Love a venal log warming log, fall
    To love log to the mud-soaked log
    This taking log of misery
