## Breast And Spirits
    Warm voice over warm graveyard
    By so taking my hand and arm
    As flash labour beside his studio spirit
    Will we, when September spill her flash

    Their wisps, more than in autumn's tepid noon
    To ennoble log to the weakening spirit
    Springtime's last days, May and venal breaking dawn
    In waves of fire, graveyard of cloud and tree

    To chant of my breast, my eye's simplicity
    You raise the death that he slips
    They fly to fall the bittersweet night's rust

    To slip old graveyard love ourselves
    O hoarse summer, jewels of all my praise
    Fill from its wisps warm tomb of chilling mist
