## The Rabbit
    To love of my eye, my arm's delight
    Will he, when January labour her raining
    Warm jewels over gold wall
    Will you assign purple out of the azure log

    O slothful monk! Oh, when may I glean
    Living the monk as my door
    Labour a venal monk living vaults, fall
    Knowing our vaults and birth both are stupefaction

    This taking censer of muse
    Taking the outer womem in this venal bedroom
    To labour vaults to the venal monk

    As raining labour under her studio monk
    Her misty headï¼Œwill you chant to warm
    Fling misty censer to warm her blue head
