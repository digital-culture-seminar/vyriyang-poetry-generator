## An Amusement
Will he, when May labour their windy

I must, to flash your meager morning bread

Assign a venal log living vaults, slip

Swing the monastery as her bedroom



Praise stupefaction, in all delight

This living spectacle of jewels

To love vaults to the mud-soaked log

Their spiritual neckï¼Œwill you slip to gold



Warming the inner child in this slothful door

As windy love outside our studio log

O slothful log! Oh, when may I glean



Venal crowd up gold wall

Love spiritual vaults to gold their blue neck

Knowing our vaults and birth both are stupefaction
