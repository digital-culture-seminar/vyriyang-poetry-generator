The Analysis of Culture
emphasis, the discovery of certain absolute or universal, or at least higher and lower,
meanings and values, through the 'documentary'emphasis, in which clarification of
a particular way of life is the main end in view, to an emphasis which, from studying
particular Meanings and values, seeks not so much to compare these, as a way o
establishing a scale, but by studying their modes of ch ange to discover certain
general laws'or'trends, by which social and cultural development as a whole can
be better understood
It seems to me that there is value in each of these kinds of definition. For it
ertainly seems necessary to look for meanings and values, the record of creative
human activity, not only in art and intellectual work, but also in institutions and
forms of behaviour. At the same time, the degree to which we depend, in our
knowledge of many past societies and past stages of our own, on the body of
intellectual and imaginative work which has retained its major communicative
ower, makes the description of culture in these terms, if not complete, at least
reasonable, It can indeed be argued that since we have for the broader
description, we can properly restrict 'cuiture' to this more limited reference. Yet
here are elements in the'ideal' definition which also seem to me valuable, and which
encourage the retention of the broad reference I fnd it very diffcult, after the many
comparative studies now on record, to identify the process of human perfection with
he discovery of 'absolute values, as these have been ordinarily defned. I accept the
criticism that these are normally an extension of the values of a particular tradition
or society. Yet, if we call the process, not human perfection, which implies a known
ideal towards which we can move, but human evolution, to mean a process of
general growth of man as a kind, we are able to recognize areas of fact which the
other definitions might exclude. For it seems to me to be true that meanings and
values, discovered in particular societies and by particular individuals, and kept
alive by social inheritance and by embodiment in particular kinds of work, have
proved to be universal im the sense that when they are learned. in any particular
situation, they can contribute radically to the growth of mans powers to enrich his
life, to regulate his society and to control his environment. We are most aware of
these elements in the form of particular techniques, in medicine, production, and
communications, but it is clear not only that these depend on more purely
intellectual disciplines, which had to be wrought out in the creative handling of
experience, but also that these disciplines in themselves, together with certain basic
ethical assumptions and certain major art forms, have proved similarly capable of
being gathered into a general tradition which seems to represent, th
man
variations and conflicts, a line of common growth. It seems reasonable to speak of
this tradition as a general human culture, while adding that it can only become
active within particular societies, being shaped, as it does so, by more local and
temporary systems
The variations of meaning and reference, in the use of culture as a term, inust be
seen, I am arguing, not simply as a disadvantage, which prevents any kind of net
and exclusive definition, but as a genuine complexity, corresponding to real
clements in experience. There is a significant reference in each of the three main
