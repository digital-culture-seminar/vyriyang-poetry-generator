## Owl
    As windy chant up his graveyard watchman
    But the meager face of her slothful course
    To fly of my eye, my eye's simplicity
    To love glass to the weakening watchman

    Our spirit, more than in summertime's dignified sky
    Around the continuous fire's wisps of bed
    Gold shroud beside gold window
    As the blankest daring spill a tomb's sweet

    To fill hoarse shroud love themselves
    Where through the night the queen is taking dignified 
    That has been steeped in rain and bedroom

    O misty wintertime, vampire of all his praise
    Springtime's last days, August and venal midnight
    Outside a weakening wall, steeped with the poison
