Project inspiration: The Flowers of Evil-Charles Baudelaire

Project achievement: Using python to generate Semi-quantitative Baudelaire's propinquity poetry 

---

The following are the basic steps to approach
* First classify the the vocabularis into category
> Re-generate the category giving the generator multiple choice
>
> Set up the random vocabularis fuction

> Try next - Random tense, voice, singular and plural

* Second set up the function of the form
> Generate candidate function
>
> Call viable function
>
> Use random function select viable function

> Try next - Add recursion loop to generate the length of the
>
> Try next - Introduce argument, local variable, parameter

* Finally generate Semi-quantitative Baudelaire's propinquity poetry 




The following are the next setp of the challenge to approach
* Easy - Structure selection
* Middle - Let the user answer specific question, control random vocabularis fuction
* Upper middle - Add control function make the user's amswer controling both the random vocabularis fuction and the structure selection 
* Hard - Try machine learning
