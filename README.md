# vyriyang-poetry-generator

When Bohemians became a revealing metaphor context, Baudelaire mixed women and death in a third imagery to the narrative the city of Paris. Poetry deconstructed language, which magnifies the metaphor and atmosphere infinitely.

In The Poetry Generator, I'm aiming to generate propinquity Baudelaire's poetry through a semi-quantitative prediction of the options of the random subjects and inheritable elements. I base on the features showed in The Flowers of Evil developed a quantitative framework to let the program transfer the influence of emotional factors in random poem generating. Through the loop inheritance of functions, the program constructs similar random poetry with unified emotions. However, the correspondence of imagery and metaphor is random, which means that the meaning is infinitely possible. Completing the illusion of our poets' dream by borrowing this process of exploring unpredictable vague fables.

Project inspiration: The Flowers of Evil-Charles Baudelaire

Project achievement: Using python to generate Semi-quantitative propinquity Baudelaire's poetry 

---

The following are the basic steps to approach
* First classify the the vocabularis into category
> Re-generate the category giving the generator multiple choice
>
> Set up the random vocabularis fuction

> Try next - Random tense, voice, singular and plural

* Second set up the function of the form
> Generate candidate function
>
> Call viable function
>
> Use random function select viable function

> Try next - Add recursion loop to generate the length of the poem
>
> Try next - Introduce argument, local variable, parameter

* Finally generate Semi-quantitative Baudelaire's propinquity poetry 




The following are the next setp of the challenge to approach
* Easy - Structure selection
* Middle - Let the user answer specific question, control random vocabularis fuction
* Upper middle - Add control function make the user's amswer controling both the random vocabularis fuction and the structure selection 
* Hard - Try machine learning

October 2nd, 2018, first step poety sample:

Sample 1:

    The Spiritual Eye
    
    
    To fling of my shoulders, my eye's delight  
    To love spectacle to the slothful muse    
    Will she labour purple out of the azure crowd    
    His vulgar shoulders，will she chant to warm    
        
    This Warming log of log    
    As windy chant under your studio muse  
    Taking the outer men in this venal graveyard 
    Love a venal muse warming spectacle, slip
      
    Ennoble poison, in all simplicity 
    Chant vulgar spectacle to warm his azure shoulders
    Will he, when April assign his windy
    
    He must, to fling his vulgar noon bread
    Knowing my spectacle and birth both are poison
    O slothful muse! Oh, when may I assign
    
    
Sample 2:
    
    Head And Flash
    
    
    O slothful crowd! Oh, when may I labour
    Swing the outer children in this slothful wall
    Steadfast graveyardstudio over steadfast living room
    As flash assign outside her sink crowd
    
    Glean a sick crowd warming glass, slip
    To chant of my head, my arm's delight
    This swing vaults of crowd
    To slip glass to the slothful crowd
    
    Warming the monk as his wall
    Will she slip out of the azure crowd
    Fling spiritual vaults to steadfast her green head
    
    Her spiritual head，will she flash to steadfast
    Will he, when January chant her flash
    Love death, in all simplicity
    
    
Sample 3:

    The Misty Log
    
     
    Will they assign red out of the azure monastery
    As raining slip below our bedroom log
    This living censer of monastery
    Labour a venal log warming censer, slip

    Knowing his censer and birth both are poison
    To ennoble censer to the venal log
    To slip of my neck, my arm's simplicity
    O slothful log! Oh, when may I chant

    Fling meager log to gold his azure neck
    Meager log down warm kitchen
    Living the inner child in this venal door

    Love poison, in all delight
    His meager neck，will they love to gold
    Will you, when October flash his raining
    
    
Sample 4:

    Cat And Owl
    
    
    Venal monk over steadfast hall
    Will she, when October love our raining
    Love poison, in all simplicity
    Living the muse as my window
    
    To love log to the venal jewels
    To flash of my wrist, my eye's simplicity
    This living glass of crowd
    Knowing her log and birth both are poison
    
    Swing the inner men in this slothful studio
    O venal jewels! Oh, when may I love
    As raining slip outside our kitchen jewels

    Will we glean red out of the azure misery
    Flash a sick jewels warming log, fall
    Our spiritual wrist，will we slip to warm
    
  
October 29th, 2018, poety sample:

Sample 1:
    
    Owl


    As windy chant up his graveyard watchman
    But the meager face of her slothful course
    To fly of my eye, my eye's simplicity
    To love glass to the weakening watchman

    Our spirit, more than in summertime's dignified sky
    Around the continuous fire's wisps of bed
    Gold shroud beside gold window
    As the blankest daring spill a tomb's sweet

    To fill hoarse shroud love themselves
    Where through the night the queen is taking dignified 
    That has been steeped in rain and bedroom

    O misty wintertime, vampire of all his praise
    Springtime's last days, August and venal midnight
    Outside a weakening wall, steeped with the poison
    
    
Sample 2:
    
    Cat And Shoulders
    That has been said in frost and window
    Our log, though, is cracked; when as he can
    Chant from her log gold graveyard of enveloping noon
    How vulgar it is on summer noon

    Blankest and funereal despite its queen
    Swing the inner womem in this venal pool
    My old shoulders, will they glean to steadfast
    Nothing is praise to the venal face

    Springtime's last days, August and funereal twilight
    Around the misty fire's queen of bed
    Your monastery, more than in summer's dignified rain

    Alert in bed to chant my shroud to ennoble
    Where through the midnight the spirit is growing daring 
    I love the stupefaction that he slips
