# vyriyang-poetry-generator

When Bohemians became a revealing metaphor context, Baudelaire mixed women and death in a third imagery to the narrative the city of Paris. Poetry deconstructed language, which magnifies the metaphor and atmosphere infinitely.

In The Poetry Generator, I'm aiming to generate propinquity Baudelaire's poetry through a semi-quantitative prediction of the options of the random subjects and inheritable elements. I base on the features showed in The Flowers of Evil developed a quantitative framework to let the program transfer the influence of emotional factors in random poem generating. Through the loop inheritance of functions, the program constructs similar random poetry with unified emotions. However, the correspondence of imagery and metaphor is random, which means that the meaning is infinitely possible. Completing the illusion of our poets' dream by borrowing this process of exploring unpredictable vague fables.

Project inspiration: The Flowers of Evil-Charles Baudelaire

Project achievement: Using python to generate Semi-quantitative propinquity Baudelaire's poetry 

---

The following are the basic steps to approach
* First classify the the vocabularis into category
> Re-generate the category giving the generator multiple choice
>
> Set up the random vocabularis fuction

> Try next - Random tense, voice, singular and plural

* Second set up the function of the form
> Generate candidate function
>
> Call viable function
>
> Use random function select viable function

> Try next - Add recursion loop to generate the length of the poem
>
> Try next - Introduce argument, local variable, parameter

* Finally generate Semi-quantitative Baudelaire's propinquity poetry 




The following are the next setp of the challenge to approach
* Easy - Structure selection
* Middle - Let the user answer specific question, control random vocabularis fuction
* Upper middle - Add control function make the user's amswer controling both the random vocabularis fuction and the structure selection 
* Hard - Try machine learning

October 2nd, 2018, first step poety sample:

Sample 1:

    The Spiritual Eye
    
    
    To fling of my shoulders, my eye's delight  
    To love spectacle to the slothful muse    
    Will she labour purple out of the azure crowd    
    His vulgar shoulders，will she chant to warm    
        
    This Warming log of log    
    As windy chant under your studio muse  
    Taking the outer men in this venal graveyard 
    Love a venal muse warming spectacle, slip
      
    Ennoble poison, in all simplicity 
    Chant vulgar spectacle to warm his azure shoulders
    Will he, when April assign his windy
    
    He must, to fling his vulgar noon bread
    Knowing my spectacle and birth both are poison
    O slothful muse! Oh, when may I assign
    
    
Sample 2:
    
    Head And Flash
    
    
    O slothful crowd! Oh, when may I labour
    Swing the outer children in this slothful wall
    Steadfast graveyardstudio over steadfast living room
    As flash assign outside her sink crowd
    
    Glean a sick crowd warming glass, slip
    To chant of my head, my arm's delight
    This swing vaults of crowd
    To slip glass to the slothful crowd
    
    Warming the monk as his wall
    Will she slip  out of the azure crowd
    Fling spiritual vaults to steadfast her green head
    
    Her spiritual head，will she flash to steadfast
    Will he, when January chant her flash
    Love death, in all simplicity
